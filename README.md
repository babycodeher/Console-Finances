# Financial Record Analysis

## Description
This financial dataset analysis was completed to test my knowledge of JavaScript as a front end web development bootcamp student. The console contains results from analysing the financial records of a company's profit and loss dataset between January 2010 and February 2017.

The results in the console shows: 

    the total number of months included in the dataset;

    the net profit/losses over the entire period;

    the amount and date for which the greatest increase in profits was recorded over the entire period;

    the amount and date for which the greatest decrease in profit was recorded over the entire period.
